# Core Machine Learning & Data Engineering

This phase focuses on building solid foundations in Machine Learning and Data Engineering.
Youâ€™ll learn how to preprocess, train, evaluate, and deploy ML models while understanding how data flows through pipelines and large-scale systems.

## Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
