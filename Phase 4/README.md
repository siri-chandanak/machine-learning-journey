## Generative AI

Learn advanced generative modeling techniques to create AI systems capable of producing text, images, and multimodal content.

- **LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT**: Techniques for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).  
- **Diffusion Models**: Generate images from text using models like Stable Diffusion.  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Learn DCGAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN for creative generation and data augmentation.  
- **Advanced Multimodal Models**: Work with CLIP and DALLÂ·E to integrate text and image understanding for generative tasks.

## Agentic AI

Implement AI agents capable of autonomous reasoning and task execution.

- **LangChain**: Build chains, agents, and tools to perform multi-step reasoning and tasks.  
- **LangSmith**: Evaluate and monitor agentic AI systems for robustness and performance.  
- **GraphRAG, CoT, ToT Methods**: Explore advanced reasoning pipelines using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) techniques.
