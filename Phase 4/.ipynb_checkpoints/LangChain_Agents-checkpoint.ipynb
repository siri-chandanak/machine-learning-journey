    "\n",
    "**Agents** are components in LangChain that use LLMs to make decisions and perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chains**: Sequential calls to LLMs or functions with fixed logic.  \n",
    "  Example: summarize â†’ analyze â†’ output.\n",
    "- **Agents**: More dynamic; they decide *which* tools to use, *when* to use them, and *in what order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents use **LLMs as reasoning engines**, following this loop:\n",
    "1. Receive a task or query.\n",
    "2. Decide which tool to use.\n",
    "3. Execute the tool.\n",
    "4. Observe results.\n",
    "5. Repeat until the goal is achieved.\n",

    "In this notebook, we learned how to:\n",
    "- Set up LangChain and an OpenAI LLM\n",
    "- Create and use tools within an agent\n",
    "- Build a **reactive reasoning agent**\n",
    "- Add **memory** for context-aware interactions\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Agents** make decisions dynamically â€” unlike chains, which are static.\n",
    "- **Tools** let LLMs access external data sources.\n",
    "- **Memory** gives agents contextual awareness across interactions.\n",
    "- LangChain makes it easy to combine reasoning + tools + memory for advanced **Agentic AI** behavior.\n",
